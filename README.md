# Auto-submitt-teams
This project automatically submits your assignment at 4:20 am in the morning.

To use this programm, you need python.
Just execute the included setup file, wich will install all required libraries.

To start the programm, start tthe .py file. Make sure you have microsoft teams in fullscreen, and that the submitt button is clearly visible.
Your scaling must be at 100%, otherwise it might not work. 

After that is clear, just wait untill the bot submitt it right at 4:20 (nice)
